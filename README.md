I’m a certified cybersecurity analyst (CompTIA Security+) with 26 years of experience in investigative law enforcement, now pursuing a second career in cybersecurity. I specialize in security operations, digital forensics, threat hunting, and incident response, with hands-on experience using SIEM tools, vulnerability management platforms, and NIST-aligned response frameworks. My mission is to apply my investigative expertise and technical training to defend organizations against evolving cyber threats and contribute meaningfully to a Security Operations Center (SOC) team.

## Objective


With a lifelong passion for technology and a recently completed career in law enforcement, I am now fully transitioning into the cybersecurity field to continue serving and protecting—this time in the digital space. My goal is to leverage both my investigative background and technical skills to secure a position as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. I’m driven by a desire to help others, protect critical systems, and make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving world of cyber defense.
